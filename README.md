# Introduction to Machine Learning

This proyect aims to review foundamental Machine Learning concepts using ChatGPT to summarize the explanations, making them (hopefully) more understandable for beginners (like myself). 

**It is only for educational purposes.**

## Objectives and considerations

- Learning the foundamentalas of Maching Learning: the first idea was to study the book *“An Introduction to Machine Learning with Python by Andreas C. Müller and Sarah Guido (O’Reilly)”*.

- Using Prompt Engineering techniques to make ChatGPT provide expanded explanations of the topics and sections from the book

So this project emerged as my personal notes and resumes while i'm studyng the text... then i started using ChatGPT website to expand on topics and it helped to build the content of the jupyter notebooks.
